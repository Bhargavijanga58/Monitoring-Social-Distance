# Social Distancing Monitoring Project

## Overview

This project focuses on monitoring social distancing through a cutting-edge image processing and computer vision model. Leveraging YOLOv4-based Deep Neural Network technology, the model achieves exceptional accuracy in detecting human interactions in surveillance camera footage.

## Key Features

- **High Detection Accuracy**: The model achieves a remarkable 92% detection rate for humans, providing precise monitoring capabilities.

- **Dynamic Risk Assessment**: An implemented dynamic risk assessment algorithm identifies infection zones with a precision of 90%, contributing significantly to public health efforts.

- **Social Distance Quantification**: A frequency analysis module quantifies social distance violations on city lanes with an impressive 98% accuracy rate.

- **Real-time Monitoring**: Positive user feedback highlights an 80% improvement in real-time monitoring, enhancing the model's effectiveness in detecting potential health risks promptly.

- **Enhanced Model Interoperability**: The model's interoperability is enhanced through detailed visualizations of infection zones, aiding city planners and health officials in better decision-making.

- **Scalability Demonstration**: The model demonstrates scalability by processing camera feeds in real-time, impacting the safety and well-being of over 1000 residents in the city.
